# SuperStore-Analysis
Data cleaning and analysis of 4 years of transactions in a retail store.

This is a full data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis project on a superstore dataset with 10,000 transactions.

This project started off as multiple messy CSV files and ended as a single cleaned dataset. We gained a number of valuable insights regarding profitability, seasonality, and growth.
